/*
Create an interface named INumberProcessor and a class that implements it.
The interface should declare a single method:

std::vector<int> process(const std::vector<int>& input);


This method receives a vector of integers and should return another vector of integers where:

all odd numbers appear first,

followed by all even numbers,

while preserving the original order within each group.

Example

Input:
{4, 1, 3, 2, 8, 5}

Expected output:
{1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 8}

You can name your implementation class however you like (for example, OddEvenPartitioner).
